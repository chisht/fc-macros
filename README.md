Elite Dangerous Fleet Carrier Macros

Currently, this plugin uses default keybindings.   It may not work with custom HUD colors because it uses image
matching to verify its screen navigation.
Because the HUD sizes are different on some ships, this may cause issues.
It's been tested on:
* Imperial Cutter
* Anaconda
* Python
* Type 9
* Beluga
* Dolphin

Requires the following python addins:

* pip install keyboard pyautogui pillow opencv-python
